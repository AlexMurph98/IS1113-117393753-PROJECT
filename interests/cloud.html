          <p>There are numerous cloud services available on the web including this website, Cloud 9.
            They are very useful as they help store information, documents and apps online. These services are utilised by most major companies today with security on these cloud services being a major issue.
            With the ever growing problem of hacking, cloud services have to ensure security on their sites.
            The various examples of cloud services are Cloud 9, Google Drive, Apple iCloud, Dropbox and many more.

          <h1 class="mainheading">Cloud 9</h1>
          <p>
              Cloud 9 was founded in 2010 and was a privately held company, however on July 14, 2016 it had been acquired by Amazon.
             AWS Cloud9 is a cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE) that lets you write, run, and debug your code with just a browser. 
             It includes a code editor, debugger, and terminal. Cloud9 comes pre-packaged with essential tools for popular programming languages including JavaScript, 
             Python, PHP, and more, so you donâ€™t need to install files or configure your development machine to start new projects. There is a great variety which meets users needs.
             Since your Cloud9 IDE is cloud-based, you can work on your projects from your office, home, or anywhere using an internet-connected machine, making it more efficient for you.
             Code from your Cloud 9 can be transferred to Github where all of your code is stored in a repository. It is essentially a storage facility for your work.
             To transfer the code to your github you use the "git add .", "git commit -am" and "git push". This is typed into a terminal in the Cloud 9 site.
             The files from your github can then be transferred to Heroku. This website hosts your web application and allows a live run of your project.
             Your Cloud 9, Github and Heroku accounts are all linked. For Heroku to launch the live version of the app you must deploy a branch to your Github account and it is then transferred over.
             These three websites combined allow ease to code and run a live web application.
