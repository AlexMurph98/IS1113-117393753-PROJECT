           <h1 class="mainheading">Software as a Service(SaaS) - Salesforce</h1>
           <p>
               Software as a service (SaaS) is a software distribution model in which a third-party provider hosts applications and makes them available to customers over the Internet. 
               SaaS is one of four main categories of cloud computing, alongside infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS) and also communication as a service (CaaS).
               <br/> <br/>
               SaaS removes the need for organizations to install and run applications on their own computers or in their own data centers. This eliminates the expense of hardware acquisition, 
               provisioning and maintenance, as well as software licensing, installation and support. Other benefits of the SaaS model include:
               <br/>
               <strong>Flexible Payments:</strong>Rather than purchasing software to install, or additional hardware to support it, customers subscribe to a SaaS offering. Generally, 
               they pay for this service on a monthly basis using a pay-as-you-go model. This makes it easier for consumers to afford this service.
               <br/>
               <strong>Scalabe Usage:</strong>Cloud services like SaaS offer high scalability, which gives customers the option to access more, or fewer, services or features on-demand.
               <br/>
               <strong>Automatic Updates:</strong>Rather than purchasing new software, customers can rely on a SaaS provider to automatically perform updates and patch management. 
               This further reduces the burden on in-house IT staff, making it as efficient as possible.
               <br/>
               <strong>Accessibilty and Persistance:</strong>Since SaaS applications are delivered over the Internet, users can access them from any Internet-enabled device and location.
               Again adding efficiency to the service.
               
           </p>
           <br/>
           <p>
              <strong>However like everything else, Saas also has its disadvantages.</strong><br/>
              Businesses must rely on outside vendors to provide the software, keep that software up and running, track and report accurate billing and facilitate a secure environment for the business' data. 
              Providers that experience service disruptions, impose unwanted changes to service offerings, experience a security breach or any other issue can have a profound effect on the customers'
              ability to use those SaaS offerings. As a result, users should understand their SaaS provider's service-level agreement, and make sure it is enforced.
