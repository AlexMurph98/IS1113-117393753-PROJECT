           <p>
               Platform as a service (PaaS) is a cloud computing model in which a third-party provider delivers hardware and 
               software tools -- usually those needed for application development -- to users over the internet. A PaaS provider
               hosts the hardware and software on its own infrastructure. As a result,
               PaaS frees users from having to install in-house hardware and software to develop or run a new application.
               <br/> <br/>
               <strong>PaaS architecture and how it works</strong><br/>
               PaaS does not typically replace a business's entire IT infrastructure. Instead, a business relies on PaaS providers for key services,
               such as application hosting or Java development. A PaaS provider builds and supplies a resilient and optimized environment on which users can install
               applications and data sets. Users can focus on creating and running applications rather than constructing and maintaining the underlying infrastructure and services.
               Many PaaS products are geared toward software development. These platforms offer compute and storage infrastructure, as well as text editing, version management, compiling
               and testing services that help developers create new software more quickly and efficiently. 
               A PaaS product can also enable development teams to collaborate and work together, regardless of their physical location.
               <br/><br/>
               <strong>PaaS Pros & Cons</strong><br/>
               The principal benefit of PaaS is simplicity and convenience for users -- the PaaS provider supplies much of the infrastructure and other IT services, which users can access
               anywhere via a web browser. PaaS providers then charge for that access on a per-use basis -- a model that many enterprises prefer, as it eliminates the capital expenses they
               traditionally 
               have for on-premises hardware and software. Some PaaS providers charge a flat monthly fee to access their service, as well as the apps hosted within it.<br/>
               Service availability or resilience, however, can be a concern with PaaS. If a provider experiences a service outage or other infrastructure disruption, this can adversely 
               affect customers and result in costly lapses of productivity. Provider lock-in is another common concern, since users cannot easily migrate many of the services and much 
               of the data produced through one PaaS 
               product to another competing product. Users must evaluate the business risks of service downtime and lock-in before they commit to a PaaS provider.
